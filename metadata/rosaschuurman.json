    "opinions": "I do not and should not have access to the circuits Rosa discussed during her Weekly Nerd, partly because the physical aspect of technology isn't really one I feel particularily drawn to. Regardless, I was very impressed with Rosa just doing it. She 'just' started tinkering, 'just' tried out new stuff, and 'just' extracted important lessons from all of this, leading to exciting projects. I really admire that.",
    "integration": "Although I don't think I'll be circuit-bending anytime soon, I do take Rosa's advice about internships and trying out new things to heart, and I intend to adopt her free-spirited mindset and 'nothing-is-too-crazy'-approach in the future!"
