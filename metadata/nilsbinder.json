    "opinions": "White-space is very important to the way we experience websites, including our attention spans, our opinions of the design and our subconscious impressions of the site in question. Though this importance is always in the back of my mind, I can't say that I've ever looked at whitespace in the way that it was demonstrated to me at this time. Nils showed us how it can tell- or hide- a story, enhance the user experience and how it can be utilized in the responsiveness of a product. Additionally, whitespace and the units to define or clarify it serve as a communicative device between designers and developers. This is to such an extent that tools like Figma even make an effort to streamline the namings and processes in their programs to make communications and designs easer to hand over between designers and developers. I hadn't been presented with this perspective before, so this talk was very interesting.",
    "integration": "I definitely see myself integrating the things Nils has taught us today. It might even serve as a challenge to see how I can leave more whitespace than I usually do to utilize the space I have in a window. I can also see how this can help improve my responsive designs and am excited to test this out!"
