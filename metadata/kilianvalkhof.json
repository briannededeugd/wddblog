    "opinions": "As the very first weekly nerd, the talk Kilian gave set a very high bar. It was the first time that I felt as though I was getting lectured on actual tags to use in HTML, and the future of coding (or 'marking up'). He had tiny prototypes for everything that he explained, which warranted the necessary ooh's and ahh's from my classmates and myself. I was very intrigued!",
    "integration": "I walked away from this weekly nerd with a new sense of excitement. In the very assignment I was working on at the time this talk was held, I used some of the methods Kilian talked about, like container queries and details + summary elements. The way that he showed us exactly what these new elements could do - emphasising how much easier they would make our lives - helped us understand the importance of the web's constant development and motivated me to keep on learning."
