    "opinions": "I learned about Q42 over a year ago. It was a regular day navigating the websites of CMD out of sheer boredom, when up popped a name I had only faintly heard before, Q42. It was a page about what alumni were doing and where they ended up, pieces of information that were growing more relevant as each day passed. Like any internet rabbit hole works, I started clicking and clicking, ultimately gaining quite a lot of knowledge on this company. And, enough admiration to want to intern there. This visit further cemented that admiration into my core. It was one of two companies I applied to (but secretly the one I hoped for most) and the more I learned, the more that want and nervousness grew. The day after this talk, I got the news that I made it!",
    "integration": "Getting the chance to see what Q42 does, as well as the things they value and the way they work, has really inspired me. I think my upcoming internship and the remainder of my Meesterproef is the perfect opportunity to reach for the stars like they do, and to use web development as a creative outlet more than I ever have. I can see myself working on projects like theirs with genuine excitement, and I can't wait to work towards that even more than I already do."
