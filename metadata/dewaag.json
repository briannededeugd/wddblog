    "opinions": "Let's be real. If someone came to you to tell you that in a few days there'll be a workshop on an unknown subject, with a duration of two hours, at the end of a workday, you wouldn't exactly be jumping with joy. Well, maybe you would, but not me. Still, I went into this with an open mind and was actually pleasantly surprised! This talk was about inclusivity in a way that it had never been presented to me before, as well as in an engaging and interesting manner. We were brought up onto our feet, given the space to share our thoughts, the time to mull over our values, and the tools to combine all of this in a creative assignment. All in all, it was an educational and plain good time.",
    "integration": "Practically, I don't think there is much to 'apply' in my web development journey, but this workshop has definitely given me some food for thought. I wonder what I will feel if I look back on this in five or ten years. I want to embrace what I've been told and taught, and use it to make accessible, inclusive, and morally upright applications and sites. I mean, that's the kind of developer anybody would want to be, right?"
