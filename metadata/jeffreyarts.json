    "opinions": "From what I gathered from my peers, this talk was interesting but not particularily relevant for our ventures. Jeffrey uses a lot of frameworks, for example, something we're discouraged from doing during our studies as CMD values knowing and mastering 'the basics' first. Additionally, this talk was mostly a showcase of Jeffrey's projects, which is interesting but not something we can directly apply once again. Despite all of this, I am definitely impressed by Jeffrey reaching out to our minor and asking for some of our time to share something he is passionate about.",
    "integration": "I haven't integrated anything of Jeffrey's at the time this talk was given, but I can see myself looking into toolkits in the way he uses them in the future."
