    "opinions": "I really appreciate the fact that there are also talks like Robert's. The future can feel really overwhelming sometimes, like a big black hole hanging over my head, ready to swallow me up at any time. The thing is, I don't know where I'll end up (does anyone)? Maybe my first official job will treat me badly, or my imposter syndrome will catch up with me, or I find out that I thought I liked development but then I wake up hating it one day. Robert's talk was like a balm to all of these worries. My opinion matters as much as my employer's does, and I'm not obligated to stay on a path just because I chose it. The future is a big black hole I cannot look into, but I won't let it swallow me. I'll enter it on my own terms, step by step.",
    "integration": "At the time that I'm writing this blog, I've gotten an internship spot at a company I very much feel inspired by. I'm extremely excited about interning there, and at the same time I'm very nervous (the kind of nervous that inhabits the pit of your stomach and makes a home there). This talk is reminding me to let the excitement win. As I approach the end of my studies, I get to enter the real world, and though that's scary - it's extremely fun!"
