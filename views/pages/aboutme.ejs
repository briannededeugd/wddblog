					<h1>About Me</h1>
					<p>
						Are you looking at this blog and thinking, <em>okay, but who</em> is
						<em>she?</em> This page answers that exact question, offering you a
						glance into my <strong>head</strong> as a person, student and
						developer (including the part of my brain that was very focused on
						this site in particular) and the <strong>heart</strong> that's in
						every single element.<br />
						<br />
						To start off, hey! My name is Brianne, I'm 21 years old and grew up
						loving anything artsy. My very first 'work of art' (that wasn't a
						stick-figure drawing) was a story I wrote when I was seven years old
						about a boat capsizing because of two enormous waves.
						Unsurprisingly, I called this story
						<strong>The Waves</strong> and specified that it was for all ages
						from seven and upwards, in protest of my school library's eight-plus
						books that I wasn't allowed to read.<br />
						<br />
						But sticking with fictional stories was boring. Throughout my life,
						I've been constantly searching for more ways and mediums to express
						my creativity, but none were quite as fulfilling as
						<strong>web design & development</strong> was when I first became
						accquainted with it in my first year of college. Now, I'm proud to
						say that my web dev journey is in its prime, and things are only
						looking up!

							I derive the most <em>joy</em> and <em>satisfaction</em> from
							creating things from scratch. Give me nothing to turn into
							something.
						</p>
						<p>
							I love creating things with my hands (or a mouse) and starting
							from a blank canvas. Websites, stories, drawings, figma designs
							that will never see the world wide web - I can never
							<em>not</em> create.
