						<h1>Goals & Plans</h1>
						<p>
							Before any meaningful project you take on, the goals you set up
							for yourself carry great importance. They can help you recognize
							your successes, find direction and keep your eyes on the goal,
							ultimately aiding in the development of a successful product.<br />

							<br />
							During the web design and development minor, defining our goals
							wasn't just a way for lecturers to track our process, but it was
							also a requirement, aiming to teach us that all we did served as a
							tool to help us grow as developers. On this page, my goals and
							plans are defined in detail.

							“If anyone at my funeral says 'it's what he would have wanted',
							I'll kick the lid off my coffin and throttle them. Or, if I've
							been cremated, I'll flip the lid off the urn and become a dust
							storm in their eyes. Only you know what you truly want. Anything
							else is presumption skewed through personal agendas.”<br />
