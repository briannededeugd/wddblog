In the realm of media and technology, the journey from conventional paths to experimental territories is often marked by individuals who dare to bend circuits, challenge norms, and explore the uncharted. Recently, I had the privilege to attend a thought-provoking Weekly Nerd where Rosa Schuurman, an explorer in this field, shared her insights and experiences. Here's a glimpse into the intriguing world she unveiled:

## Creative Coding

Rosa's journey originates from a background in CMD (Communication and Multimedia Design), with a stint in web development. Presently, she's delving deeper into the realms of experimental publishing through a master's program.

Rosa defines creative coding as "creative bookkeeping." It's not about unveiling the secrets to vast wealth accumulation but rather about exploring possibilities beyond conventional paths.

She elucidated potential career paths post-CMD, including UX design and React development, shedding light on her own journey, which involved five years at Elastique/Wetteloos as a digital creative. She's also dedicated time to fine art at WKDA, birthing what she describes as "a vitrinekast," and currently pursues her MFA at Piet Zwart, where she delves into workshops, synthesizers, radio, and website construction.

## Circuit Bending

Circuit bending, as Rosa describes it, involves creatively manipulating circuits in electronic devices to craft new musical or visual instruments. It's about repurposing existing frameworks to make something new. Rooted in the 1970s, circuit bending finds its origins amidst the emergence of electronic art and unstable media, providing an immediate canvas for experimentation.

Rosa advocates for a hands-on approach to circuit bending, encouraging us to rely on our senses and ingenuity to explore short-circuits and bypass systems, ultimately fostering interaction. She has a few pre-determined steps that we can take, should we be interested in circuit-bending ourselves:

- Consider batteries only;
- Use your eyes, ears, hands, nose and (maybe most importantly) your _brain_;
- Look for short-circuits, try to bypass systems;
- Mark what you find;
- Create some kind of interaction.

> It's a lifestyle. Eventually you will circuit-bend it all.

She warns us, through! Side effects may include, (1) _an unprecedented enthusiasm for hand-me-downs_, (2) _the belief that everything is feasible and bendable_, and (3) _a very strong urge to get rid of the black box_.


Drawing parallels to browser tools like 'Inspect' or 'Inspect Element,' she highlights how circuit bending extends beyond physical manipulation, including the installation of alternative software, exemplified by her work with _postmarketOS_.

The key takeaway Rosa wants us to go home with is that rejecting the status quo is pivotal in circuit bending, echoing her sentiment to challenge norms and explore beyond the boundaries. She advises us to let the games begin and play around with softwares like [Pure Data](https://puredata.info/) and [GameMaker Studio](https://gamemaker.io/en).

## An eye on our futures

While acknowledging the importance of hard skills, Rosa tells us about the significance of positioning oneself as a critical maker, asserting that frameworks matter little in the grand scheme of things. Whether we use React or Svelte or no frameworks at all really won't matter in the long one. Furthermore, we must immerse ourselves in inspiring environments and companies and seek enriching internships and engagements. It should be a fun place to be both physically and virtually.

## Workshops 

As a roadmap for enthusiasts, Rosa highlights workshop hubs in Utrecht and Amsterdam, fostering creativity and collaboration:

### Utrecht
1. CCU (Creative Coding Utrecht);
2. Modelation Utrecht;
3. Acid Solder Club.

### Amsterdam
1. OT301;
2. Fiber Festival;
3. INC (does a lot of research, including from AUAS);
4. Hackers & Designers het HEM;
5. LI-MA.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Rosa's narrative serves as a testament to the boundless possibilities within media and technology when one dares to challenge conventions, embrace experimentation, and surround oneself with inspiration. As Rosa aptly puts it, 

> Surround yourself with people who inspire you, companies doing cool things, and intern there.
