On April 3rd, Pim Schuurman and Marieke de Hoop shared insights on digital accessibility during the Weekly Nerd session. Marieke, a researcher and former CMD student, is part of _Active Collective_, while Pim co-founded the company. Five years ago, they transitioned from a design agency to specialize in accessibility, now consisting of an eight-person team.

## Who gets left out?
Have you ever considered who gets excluded from digital spaces? It's not just about physical disabilities; it's about clarity and color contrasts, ensuring content remains accessible even under bright sunlight. Captions aren't just for entertainment; they're vital for the deaf or hard of hearing. Temporary limitations like a broken hand or cognitive impairments due to medications also pose challenges. And then there are permanent disabilities, like blindness or ADHD.

Sometimes, we inadvertently exclude others, like when we design for the majority, leaving out the needs of minorities such as the visually impaired or those with cognitive differences.

## Designing with inclusivity in mind
Are there design choices you've made that inadvertently exclude people? It's a question worth pondering.

Digital accessibility is governed by standards like WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines), which outline criteria to ensure inclusivity. Companies like _Active Collective_ test against these standards, evaluating 50 criteria across four main areas known as "The Big Four."

### The Big Four (POUR)
- _Perceivable_: Can everyone perceive the content?
- _Operable_: Can everyone interact with and use the content?
- _Understandable_: Is the content clear and understandable to everyone?
- _Robust_: Is the technology behind our digital product correctly structured?

Let's dive into some specific guidelines:

**1.4.2 Audio Control**     
Any sound lasting more than 3 seconds must be controllable: paused, stopped, or its volume reduced.

**2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap**  
Users navigating with a keyboard shouldn't get stuck in an element.

**2.2.2 Pause Stop Hide**   
Elements like animations or scrolls should be controllable or hidden if they last longer than 5 seconds.

**2.3.1 Three Flashes or Below Threshold**  
Pages shouldn't have elements that flash more than three times in a second.

### What's next?
Here are some actionable tips to improve digital accessibility:

- Focus on Low Hanging Fruit: Start with the basics using the four main areas.
- Listen with a Screen Reader: Experience your content through tools like VoiceOver for MacOS or NVDA for Windows.
- Navigate with a Keyboard: Ensure your content is accessible without a mouse.
- Test with Your Target Audience: Nothing beats real-world testing with the people you're designing for.

> Digital accessibility isn't just about compliance; it's about empathy and inclusivity.

By embracing these principles, we can create digital spaces that truly welcome everyone.
