Robert Spier was a lecturer at my major up until a year ago, and has returned to the lecture hall to calm our nerves about what comes after our time at university. Not only was Robert a lecturer; he was the coordinator of 'Blok Tech', which introduced me to **NodeJS**, **Express** and the **CLI**, among others. He is now a part of the _Digital Factory team_ at _Deloitte_ as a _creative technologist_, and was once a student just like us. Upon receiving the question, _what is a creative technologist?_, Robert answers that it's a digital superhero. There's frontend development, accompanied by a bunch of hobbies.

> Today is about me, and quite a lot about _you_.

## Creative technologist
As a creative technologist, Robert gets his hands dirty with frontend development, research in emerging technologies and qualitative research with users. Not only that, but he also identifies and manages stakeholders. He enjoys coming up with super creative solutions to obscure problems and automating everything he can. And, as it's part of the job description, Robert's there for a lot of team meetings.

Technology-wise, Robert builds stuff with **HTML**, **CSS (SASS)** and **JavaScript**, and relies heavily on **Vite** and **Sveltekit**. **Angular** threatens to fade into obscurity in Robert's workspace, and he uses some **.net/NodeJS** and **Azure**. He makes 'magical things' using several **RestAPI** and **NPM modules**, and works in the terminal but prefers **VSCode** and **Github Desktop**.

## Enough about him, now onto us!
With a curious glint in his eye, Robert asks the room what we want to be when we grow up - a question I admittedly haven't heard in years. When I was younger, the answer would've been something like design, or a stewardess, or a writer. But today, my answer is, _I want to be a creative developer_. Robert assures us that CMD is the ideal course for anything (okay, maybe I can't get on the plane right after graduating, but you get the gist). We aren't just being taught the ins-and-outs of the dark VSCode interface, nor are we led into forests to meditate on nature to get answers for an art piece, but the two extremes meet in the middle, teaching us to be well-rounded developers and designers.

Robert clarifies his original question by then asking us, "_where would you like to work when you grow up_?"
- Design agency
- Startup
- Webshop
- Freelance
- Corporate
- Or none of the above?

## Those who went before us
Imagine, it's July 2025, or perhaps a little bit later. The question of what steps we'll take next will be prevalent then, more than ever. Robert asked a few alumni to tell us about the steps _they_ have taken after their graduation, as a way to inspire us and present us with a few of many options.

### Alumnus one
The first alumnus graduated in 2022 and works in the _Detachering (in the energy branch)_. They mostly work with **Angular** and **Tailwind** and earn around _€3000,-_.

### Alumnus two
The second alumnus graduated in 2023 and is currently doing a _traineeship in finance_. They mostly work with **Vue** and **Bootstrap** and earn around _€2900,-_.

### Alumnus three
The third alumnus graduated in 2017 and currently _owns a design studio and does freelance work in Bali_. (This resonated with me because I did my internship in Bali, consider my attention piqued!) They work with **React/Next** and **Sanity**, and earn _€80 an hour_ or _€2100,-_.

### Alumnus four
The fourth and final alumnus graduated in 2023 and works at a _full-service agency_. They mostly work with **SvelteKit** and **Vite** and earn _€2600,-_.

## Five things that play along when searching for a job
There is a vast difference between the years 2017 and 2025. To name just a few, there's inflation, job roles, flexibility and culture. Robert emphasizes that it's _our_ responsibility to stay up-to-date in order to respond to and navigate these changes. We must _learn the fundamentals_, _remain curious_, _stay informed_ and _enjoy discovering_. Additionally, the type of employer we end up with carries its own weight. We could freelance, do a traineeship, end up in detachering, work at a design studio, get a job at a full service agency or find our spot at a company's in-house services. But our options aren't limited to this fork in the road. We could also continue studying or do something completely different. All of these things have their own advantages and disadvantages.

## The stack
Every developer has their own favorite programming languages. Robert tells us,

> You can learn everything once you know the basics. Everything is basically the same.

He also says, "_Please never ask me to write React or Next. But maybe you'll love it. Give it a chance._" (Though this wouldn't look as good quoted.) These days, the most popular programming languages are,
- NodeJS
- React
- jQuery(!)
- Express
- Angular
- Vue
Robert himself learns new languages, frameworks and technologies every year (and pretends to know them fluently on LinkedIn).

## The money
Then the next question arises, _How much do you want to earn_? There's so much to consider. The money versus the benefits, bruto versus netto, fulltime versus parttime, to name a few. So, what is a good salary? Robert says, discuss this with your peers, use the internet or apply to jobs and calculate your monthly costs. A normal salary is what you can do, combined with how your peers are being evaluated and how much your company can pay.

As for the benefits, they can include travel reinbursement, vacation money, pension building, development budgets, bonuses, profit sharing, stock options, a flexible budget or perhaps a car. What's most important is _balance_.

## The vibe
One thing people often forget in their considerations is _immaterial recognition_, which means the ability to say, "yeah dude, this place is awesome!" Think about things like leaving early on a Friday, awesome colleages and mentoring, fun outings and drinks, proximity to home, or loads of autonomy in projects. That being said, it's no subsitute to a fair and honest salary combined with the realistic experience of a junior.

## Conclusion
Always always always discuss benefits with your classmates. Do your own research and know that it's okay to say no to a company. And finally: it's your career, you will go there every day. Have fun and feel recognized. That's the most important part!

The best way you learn is by doing your own projects. Tutorials will only get you so far. _Go build epic shit_! It is okay to fail, it's better to build ten average things than to end up getting stuck on a single perfect one. Network as much as you can! Robert Spier never had a portfolio, but people still find him because he meets them, reaches out to them and interacts with them. Soft skills are vital.
