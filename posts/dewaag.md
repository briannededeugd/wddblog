The FutureLab at De Waag stands is passionate about the ethical and societal impacts of (emerging) technologies. They want to foster critical reflection on technology, question cultural assumptions, and experiment with alternatives grounded in public values. This mission is not just about innovation for innovation's sake; it's about co-developing technology with society to pave the way for an open, fair, and inclusive future.

## Mission and perspectives

FutureLab’s mission is multifaceted. It aims to:
- Strengthen critical reflection on technology by testing emerging technologies.
- Question cultural assumptions inherent in technological advancements.
- Experiment with alternatives that prioritize public values.
- Develop these technologies collaboratively with the society to work towards an open, fair, and inclusive future.

From a perspective standpoint, FutureLab emphasizes the importance of viewing technology from the citizen’s viewpoint. They categorize this perspective into multiple layers, much like the layers of a mobile phone ecosystem.

## The mobile phone as a stacked ecosystem

To understand the complexity of modern technology, FutureLab uses the mobile phone as an example. A mobile phone is more than just a device; it is a stacked ecosystem comprised of:

- **Content:** The media and information accessible through the device.
- **Services:** Functionalities provided to the user, often over the internet.
- **Apps:** Applications that enable various tasks and entertainment.
- **Software Libraries:** Collections of pre-written code that developers use to build apps.
- **Exchange Protocol Standards:** Rules that govern how data is exchanged.
- **App Distribution Centers (Stores):** Platforms like Google Play Store and Apple's App Store.
- **Firmware:** Low-level software controlling the device hardware.
- **Operating Systems:** The software backbone like Android or iOS.
- **Mobile Hardware:** The physical components of the device.
- **Cloud Servers:** Remote servers that store and manage data.

Each layer is interdependent, reflecting the complexity and the multitude of elements that shape our interaction with mobile technology.

## The layers of tech development

FutureLab deconstructs technology into four fundamental layers, each with its values and influences:

1. **Foundation:** This layer encompasses the context in which technology is developed. It includes the starting points and assumptions of the creators. Understanding these fundamentals is crucial for recognizing the biases and intentions embedded in technology.

2. **Design Process:** The methods and techniques used to design technology can be open or closed (secretive). De Waag advocates for openness in the design process, emphasizing the importance of listening to users and those affected by the design. The design process significantly influences the trajectory of digitalization and its societal impact.

3. **Tech Stack:** This includes the services, security measures, and protocols/standards that dictate what is allowed and limited within the technology. It forms the backbone of the technological ecosystem.

4. **Citizen-Centric Approach:** At the pinnacle of FutureLab’s approach is the citizen, envisioned not as a mere consumer within a corporate model or a subject under a state, but as an active participant in a democratic society. This approach underscores our interaction with technology and its reciprocal influence on our lives.

## Conclusion

The FutureLab at De Waag is more than just a tech lab; it is a movement towards reimagining our relationship with technology. By focusing on public values and inclusivity, they are sort of paving a pathway towards a future where technology _serves_ us equitably and ethically, not the other way around. It's kind of inevitable that technology is ever-growing in importance and significance, not just in our lives but in our ecosystem. FutureLab’s mission and methodologies offer a somewhat of a blueprint for a fairer and more inclusive technological future, and I commend them for it.
