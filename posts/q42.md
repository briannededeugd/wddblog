Q42 is a digital product studio in Amsterdam and The Hague. They have built products for some big names, such the _HEMA_ app, the website for the _Rijksmuseum_, _Philips Hue_, the _Wie is de Mol_ app and the _PostNL_ app, to just name a few. But they're not merely builders. I'd categorize them more as digital product engineers or imagineers like the ones that Disney employs in their parks. Our visit to their Amsterdam office turned our regular wednesday afternoon into one of many ooh's and aah's as we were presented with some of their amazing works.

_*Sidenote: I didn't take many notes as I was very captivated by the talks, so this blog is a nerd's recollection. You've been warned._

## Mathmetical graphs for blind students
The first project we were shown was an app that described mathmetical graphs to blind students. It wasn't something I had considered before, but a lot of math are visual elements that we soak up in seconds when we steal a glance. Now think about how you would explain such a graph to someone who can't see it. How long would it take you? How often would you stumble over your words, and how long would it take the person you're explaining it to to understand what you're trying to portray?

For this same reason, Q42 ventured to find a different solution and tackle this problem as efficiently as possible. The result? Not words - _sounds_.
